# Building the DIAL server and client
The DIAL client is a standalone C++ console application you can use to test 
a running DIAL server implementation on your device. Unlike the server, which
is built for, and meant to run on your device, the client is meant to run on 
your desktop (development) machine. 

The DIAL client uses CURL to send HTTP REST commands to the DIAL server, so to
build the client, you need to ensure that the CURL dependencies are 
defined properly. 

See the [INSTALL](INSTALL) document for details regarding building.

# Running
## DIAL server
The DIAL server should be started as a service, after the platform's networking
has been initialized, and it should remain running at all times (a daemon 
process in the system).

## DIAL client
### interactive (menu) mode
1. The DIAL client application must be running in the same subnet as the 
   DIAL server.
2. Start the client: `./dialclient` (or `./dialclient -m`)  
   The on-screen menu will list all available actions.

### conformance test (non-interactive) mode
1. The DIAL client application must be running in the same subnet as the 
   DIAL server.
2. Start the client: 
   `./dialclient -i [input-file] [-o output-file] [-a server-IP-addr]`

   In script-driven mode, the client reads in an input-file, executes the
   instructions in the input-file, and generates a 
   report. The default file locations (which can be overridden) are: 
   - `./dialclient_input.txt`
   - `./report.html`

### Usage
When running the DIAL client, you have the following options

    usage: dialclient <option>

    Option Parameter          Description
    -h     none               Usage menu
    -m     none               Use menu
    -o     filename           Reporter output file (./report.html)
    -i     filename           Input File (./dialclient_input.txt)
    -a     ip_address         IP addr of DIAL server (used for conformance testing)

If you do not provide an ip_address and multiple servers are discovered, the 
client will prompt you to select a server.
